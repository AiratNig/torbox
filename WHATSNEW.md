#Changes for 01-04-2016:

* Orange Pi One support
* Initial image aligned to SD card
* Only script.bin for OrangePi PC and Orange Pi One left - since operation is headless. 
* I2P update to .25 version 
* Default operation mode is DIRECT - this will allow to access freshly-boot device via name defined in config (e.g. http://orangepi.torbox:3000)
